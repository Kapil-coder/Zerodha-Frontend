            We kick-started operations on the 15th of August, 2010 with the goal
            of breaking all barriers that traders and investors face in India
            in terms of cost, support, and technology. We named the company
            <strong> Zerodha</strong>, a combination of Zero and "Rodha", the
            Sanskrit word for barrier.
          </p>
